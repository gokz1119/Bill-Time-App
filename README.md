# Bill-Time-App
This is a simple app that I made as a part of Android Study Jams 2020. This is an android app built using Kotlin. It uses Navigation libraries and concepts like View Binding. The design is based on Google's Material Design. The screenshots of the app's working are provided in the Screenshots directory.

The app consists of two screens:
  1. For calculating a tip, which takes the bill amount and quality of service as inputs and gives us an amount which is to be given as tip.
  2. For spliting a bill, which takes the bill amount and the number of persons as inputs and gives us the amount that each one has to pay.
